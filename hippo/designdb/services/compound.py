        Resolves many SMILES to :class:`CompoundModel` rows in a fixed number of
        queries instead of one ``get_or_create`` (2 statements) per SMILES.

        The per-record version issues 2 statements per molecule; this issues at most
        4 in total regardless of batch size:

        0. ``SELECT`` existing compounds by exact SMILES
        1. ``SELECT`` existing compounds by registration hash
        2. ``bulk_create`` the missing ones (``ignore_conflicts``, so it is safe
           against a concurrent writer inserting the same hash)
        3. ``SELECT`` the full hash → compound mapping back

        Step 3 is needed because ``ignore_conflicts=True`` makes PostgreSQL skip the
        ``RETURNING`` clause, so ``bulk_create`` cannot populate primary keys. Steps
        1-3 are skipped entirely when step 0 resolves everything.

        Duplicate SMILES within ``smiles_list`` are collapsed before any DB work.

        Registration hashing dominates this method's cost (~6 ms/mol), so it is
        avoided wherever possible and parallelised otherwise:

        - ``compounds.compound_smiles`` is UNIQUE and indexed, so a SMILES already
          in the database is resolved by an indexed lookup and **never hashed**.
          Re-loading a file therefore costs almost no CPU.
        - whatever remains is hashed across processes by
          :func:`compound_hashes_from_smiles`.

        :param smiles_list: SMILES strings to resolve; duplicates are tolerated
        :param max_workers: hashing worker processes; see
            :func:`compound_hashes_from_smiles`
        :param batch_size: rows per INSERT statement; ``None`` picks the safe
            per-model maximum. See :func:`safe_batch_size`.
        :returns: mapping of SMILES to ``(compound, created)``, matching the return
            shape of :meth:`create`. SMILES whose hash could not be computed are
            absent from the mapping.
